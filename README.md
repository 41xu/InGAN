## Comments and examples will be added soon.

- To train use the configs file to set options and input image path, then run train.py.
- Once trained, testing and producing a video and a grid of various sizes can be done by test.py (use the saved checkpoint).
- To train multiple files in parallel use train_supp_mat.py
- Creating a video with various animations (like our supp-video) can be done using supp_video.py
